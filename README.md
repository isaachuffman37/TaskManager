# Overview
   
The best way to test this project on a server is to "cd" into the folder with the program and run "npm start" in the terminal. This will run the compiler in the terminal and warn you if there are any compiling issues. This will aslo start the test server on a local host at the address "http://localhost:3000/" 

This web app serves as a task manager. It accepts input from the user through the text boxes and then displays the task in the table below it. The user can choose to make it as done or delete it. If it is marked at done, it is removed from that table and moves to the "Done" table beneath it. Then the user can delete the task if they want from there.   
{Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.}

I chose to do this simple web application so that I could learn the basics of React. Before this, I have never used React and instead have just used vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I have learned a lot about React so far and am excited to learn more as I continue enhancing this project.

# Development Environment

VSCode

JavaScript, HTML, CSS, bootstrap library.

# Useful Websites

* [React Documentation](https://react.dev/learn)
* [Bootstrap Documentation](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/docs/components/)

# Future Work

* Impprove the styling so that it is more visually pleasing
* Add a database backend so the tasks are not deleted after refreshing
* Create a link to a second page that tracks the task history even after being deleted
